# CoBoT Alpha version (Grivei)

A chatbot, written in Java SE, based on the award winning bot of Dr. Wallace (ALICE bot) with uses AIML to store its knowledge database.

CoBoT was trained to understand Romanian and is unique in this regard (although it knows little).

Unlike other bots, CoBoT's AIML files were trained based on a stemmed Romanian dictionary, which is provided for convenience in resources folder and can do a few tricks (like using Java autoreflection to call services)

It was created to help citizens understand better what corruption is and what is not (still in the process) yet it is very universal and requires little tuning to make it of use for general or commercial purposes. 

On behalf of the #CoBoT team, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to the Norwegian people reprezented by the Norwegian embassy in Moldova and UNDP for all their support and contribution. 

In the next phase we would like to implement the persistency level using Java JPA.
