# CoBoT-3.0 - Bot2.0

## Cobot brains.
Cobot is a small step forward from the award winning bot created by Dr. Wallace.

Cobot uses a proto-romanian-like language in an AIML db to pick answers.
This language is formed in the process of recursively lemmatizing romanian sentences and as we show, solves many issues arising from the linguistic polymorphsm of sencences.


Since there are no lemmatizing tools in Romanian, we used stemming based on a dictionary containing key-value pairs.
